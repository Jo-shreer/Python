📘 APACHE AIRFLOW: OVERVIEW

1️⃣ WHAT IS AIRFLOW?
• Apache Airflow is an **open-source platform** to programmatically **author, schedule, and 
  monitor workflows** (ETL, ML pipelines, data integration jobs).  
• Workflows are represented as **DAGs (Directed Acyclic Graphs)** — tasks are nodes, dependencies are edges.  
• Airflow allows defining workflows in **Python code**, providing flexibility and modularity.

2️⃣ WHY AIRFLOW IS NEEDED?
• **Automation**: Automatically run ETL, data ingestion, ML, or analytics pipelines on a schedule.  
• **Monitoring & Logging**: Track workflow execution, detect failures, and get alerts.  
• **Dependency Management**: Ensures tasks run in the correct order and handles upstream/downstream dependencies.  
• **Scalability**: Can orchestrate workflows across multiple machines or clusters.  
• **Flexibility**: Python-based DAGs allow integration with any data source or external system.

3️⃣ ADVANTAGES OF AIRFLOW
• **Programmatic Workflows**: Workflows are Python code, making them versionable, testable, and flexible.  
• **Dynamic DAGs**: Can create DAGs programmatically based on parameters or external data.  
• **Scheduling**: Built-in scheduler allows daily, hourly, or cron-style execution.  
• **Monitoring & Alerts**: Track task success/failure and send notifications.  
• **Extensible**: Supports custom operators, hooks, and plugins for integration with any system (S3, Redshift, Spark, Hadoop, etc.).  
• **Retry & Error Handling**: Built-in retry mechanisms and failure handling per task.  
• **Visualization**: Web UI provides DAG graphs, task timelines, logs, and status dashboards.

4️⃣ AIRFLOW COMPONENTS

1. **DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph)**
   • Represents the workflow.  
   • Tasks are nodes; dependencies are edges.  
   • Defined in Python code.

2. **Task**
   • Single unit of work in a DAG (Python function, Bash command, Spark job, etc.).  
   • Can have dependencies on other tasks.

3. **Operator**
   • Template for a task.  
   • Types:
     - PythonOperator → run Python functions  
     - BashOperator → run bash commands  
     - SparkSubmitOperator → submit Spark jobs  
     - EmailOperator → send emails  
     - Custom operators → extend functionality

4. **Scheduler**
   • Continuously monitors DAG definitions.  
   • Triggers tasks based on schedule intervals and dependencies.

5. **Executor**
   • Determines **how and where tasks run**.  
   • Examples:
     - SequentialExecutor → local, single-threaded (development)  
     - LocalExecutor → local multi-processing  
     - CeleryExecutor → distributed across worker nodes  
     - KubernetesExecutor → tasks run in Kubernetes pods

6. **Metadata Database**
   • Stores DAG definitions, task instances, state, and execution logs.  
   • Supported DBs: PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite (for development)

7. **Web UI**
   • Dashboard to monitor DAGs, tasks, execution history, retries, and logs.  
   • Allows triggering DAGs manually and managing workflows.

8. **Hooks**
   • Interfaces to external systems (S3, Redshift, MySQL, etc.).  
   • Operators use hooks internally for integration.

9. **XCom (Cross-Communication)**
   • Mechanism for tasks to exchange small pieces of data (messages or results) between tasks.

5️⃣ AIRFLOW ARCHITECTURE FLOW
1. DAG is defined in Python code.  
2. Scheduler parses DAGs and determines which tasks need to run.  
3. Executor runs tasks according to dependencies and schedule.  
4. Tasks perform work (ETL, ML, scripts, API calls, etc.).  
5. Metadata DB stores states; Web UI provides monitoring and logs.  
6. Alerts and retries handle failures automatically.

✅ SUMMARY
• Airflow is a **workflow orchestration tool** for ETL, analytics, and ML pipelines.  
• Its main advantages: automation, scheduling, monitoring, dependency management, and extensibility.  
• Key components: DAG, Task, Operator, Scheduler, Executor, Metadata DB, Web UI, Hooks, XCom.  
• Airflow is highly scalable, flexible, and widely used in modern data engineering pipelines.
