1. Can you walk me through a recent project where you designed and implemented a distributed data pipeline?
What technologies did you use?
How did you handle failures and retries in your pipeline?

- ## ‚úÖ Project Overview
**Use Case:** Streaming and processing user activity logs from a web application for real-time analytics and ML.

**Goal:** Build a scalable, fault-tolerant distributed data pipeline to ingest, process, and store event data in near real-time.

## üß± Architecture Overview

### 1. Data Ingestion Layer
- **Technology:** Apache Kafka
- **Purpose:** Acts as the central message broker. All app services publish user activity events.
- **Details:**
  - Topics partitioned by user ID
  - Data serialized using Avro or Protobuf

### 2. Stream Processing Layer
- **Technologies:** Apache Flink OR Apache Spark Structured Streaming
- **Purpose:** Real-time transformations, enrichment, filtering, aggregation
- **Processing Examples:**
  - Sessionization (grouping user activity into sessions)
  - IP-to-location enrichment
  - Filtering bot traffic
  - Output to analytics and ML feature stores

### 3. Storage Layer
- **Technologies:**
  - Amazon S3 ‚Äì raw & processed data lake
  - Snowflake / Amazon Redshift ‚Äì analytics & dashboards
  - Redis / Cassandra ‚Äì low-latency ML feature serving

### 4. Monitoring & Orchestration
- **Orchestration:** Apache Airflow (for batch jobs, dependencies, retries)
- **Monitoring:** Prometheus + Grafana, Datadog, OpenTelemetry
- **Logging:** Fluentd or Filebeat ‚Üí Elasticsearch (optional)

## üîÅ Failure Handling & Retries

### Kafka (Ingestion)
- Messages persisted for X days ‚Üí replayable
- Consumers track offsets ‚Üí failure recovery by re-reading from last checkpoint

### Flink / Spark (Processing)
- **Checkpointing:**
  - Flink: Exactly-once via state snapshots
  - Spark: Checkpointing to S3/HDFS
- **Retries:**
  - Cluster manager (YARN/K8s) restarts failed jobs
  - Resume from checkpoint / offset

### Dead Letter Queues (DLQ)
- Kafka DLQ for malformed or problematic records
- Supports offline analysis and replay

### Backpressure & Alerts
- Monitor lag and throughput
- Alert on lag thresholds
- Auto-scale consumers if needed
- Circuit breakers if downstream systems fail

### Airflow (Batch ETL Jobs)
- Retries via `retries`, `retry_delay` parameters
- Slack / PagerDuty alerts on failure
- Sensors for upstream data readiness

## üéØ Results

- Real-time latency < 10s end-to-end
- Exactly-once delivery via checkpointing
- Scales to billions of events/day
- Resilient to node and network failures
- Operational alerts and automated recovery in place
