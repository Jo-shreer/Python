## PySpark
â€¢ PySpark is the Python API for Apache Spark.  
â€¢ It allows you to use Python to write Spark applications.  
â€¢ Apache Spark is a distributed computing framework for big data processing and analytics.  
â€¢ PySpark enables large-scale data processing across multiple machines (clusters).  
â€¢ It provides high-level APIs for DataFrames, SQL, streaming, and machine learning (MLlib).  
â€¢ It combines Pythonâ€™s simplicity with Sparkâ€™s speed and scalability.  
â€¢ Commonly used for ETL, data analytics, and big data machine learning tasks.

## Apache Spark architecture (how PySpark works internally).
â€¢ Apache Spark follows a masterâ€“slave architecture with a Driver and Executors.  
â€¢ The **Driver** program runs the main control flow â€” it creates the SparkSession, builds the logical plan, and sends tasks to Executors.  
â€¢ **Executors** are worker processes running on cluster nodes â€” they execute the tasks assigned by the Driver.  
â€¢ Data in Spark is distributed across Executors in partitions (chunks of data).  
â€¢ Spark performs transformations lazily â€” it builds a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) of execution.  
â€¢ When an action (like show(), count(), or write()) is called, Sparkâ€™s scheduler optimizes and executes the DAG on the cluster.  
â€¢ The **Cluster Manager** (like YARN, Kubernetes, or Spark Standalone) allocates resources (CPU, memory) to the Driver and Executors.  
â€¢ PySpark communicates with the JVM-based Spark engine through the Py4J library â€” letting Python commands run on the JVM backend.  
â€¢ This architecture makes Spark fast, fault-tolerant, and scalable for large datasets.

## key components of PySpark
â€¢ SparkSession â€“ The entry point to any PySpark program. 
                     It allows you to create DataFrames, run SQL queries, and manage Spark configurations.
                     
â€¢ SparkContext â€“ The core connection to the Spark cluster. 
                    It manages the communication between your application and the cluster. (SparkSession internally creates it.)
                    
â€¢ **RDD (Resilient Distributed Dataset)** â€“ The low-level data structure in Spark. 
                                            It represents an immutable, distributed collection of data across nodes in a cluster.
                                            
â€¢ **DataFrame** â€“ A distributed collection of data organized into named columns (like a SQL table). 
                  Itâ€™s built on top of RDDs and provides high-level operations.
                  
â€¢ **Dataset** â€“ A strongly-typed distributed data structure (mainly used in Scala/Java). 
                In PySpark, DataFrames are used instead.
                
â€¢ **Transformations** â€“ Lazy operations (like filter, map, select) that describe how data should be modified but donâ€™t execute immediately.

â€¢ **Actions** â€“ Operations (like show, count, collect, write) that trigger the actual computation and return a result.

â€¢ **Spark SQL** â€“ A module that lets you query structured data using SQL syntax on top of DataFrames.

â€¢ **PySpark Streaming** â€“ A module to process real-time data streams (for example, data from Kafka or sockets).

â€¢ **MLlib** â€“ Sparkâ€™s machine learning library for scalable ML algorithms (classification, regression, clustering, etc.).

â€¢ **GraphX / GraphFrames** â€“ Used for graph-based computations (e.g., PageRank, social network analysis).

â€¢ **Cluster Manager** â€“ Allocates resources and manages nodes (examples: YARN, Kubernetes, or Spark Standalone).
