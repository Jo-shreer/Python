How I Structure DAGs

# Modular Design
I break down complex workflows into smaller, reusable DAGs or tasks. Instead of one giant DAG, 
I create smaller DAGs that can be triggered independently or via sensors/operators. This improves readability and maintainability.

# Clear Naming Conventions
DAG IDs, task IDs, and file names follow a consistent pattern, usually something like projectname_tasktype_frequency 
(e.g., ecommerce_daily_etl). This makes it easy to identify purpose and schedule at a glance.

# Parameterization & Templates
I use Jinja templating and parameters to avoid hardcoding values like dates, file paths, or environment variables. This allows the same DAG to be used across environments or dates without changing code.

# Separation of Concerns
Logic inside tasks is kept minimal; I separate orchestration (Airflow DAGs) from business logic (Python scripts, SQL files). 
Tasks usually call external scripts or functions rather than embedding heavy logic in the DAG file itself.

#  Use of Task Groups
For readability, especially in DAGs with many tasks, I group related tasks into TaskGroups. This visually organizes the graph and helps manage dependencies.

#  Best Practices Iâ€™ve Found Useful

# Idempotency: 
Make sure tasks can run multiple times without causing issues (important for retries and backfills). For example, overwrite output files or use upsert logic in databases.

# Avoid Long-Running Tasks Inside Airflow: 
Keep task execution time short. If you have long processes, use Airflow to kick off jobs on external systems (like Spark, EMR, or Kubernetes) and just monitor their status.

# Retries and Alerts: 
Set sensible retry counts and delays. Configure email/slack alerts for failures so the team is promptly notified.

# Version Control & CI/CD: 
Keep DAGs in version control. Automate testing (unit tests on DAG definitions) and deployment to reduce human error.

# Use XCom Sparingly: 
While XComs are useful, avoid passing large data blobs through XCom. Instead, pass file paths or IDs referencing data stored externally.

# Clear Documentation: 
Add doc_md strings on DAGs and tasks to explain purpose, schedule, and parameters. This helps onboard new team members and maintain the code.

# Parameterize Schedules and Start Dates: 
Avoid hardcoding start dates; instead, use variables or configs so you can backfill easily if needed.
